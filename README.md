# cmdplay-pp
# What is this?
This is the next version of CmdPlay (https://github.com/mariiaan/CmdPlay).
It's an improved version of the original project.

# Features
Plays videos back in command line in ascii-art.

# What got better
- now uses multi-threading for decoding videos!
- way faster
- doesn't need to precompute all frames before playing them back, does it while playing!

# Libraries, this project depends on
- ffmpeg (https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
- bass.dll (https://www.un4seen.com/)

thank you for all your support
